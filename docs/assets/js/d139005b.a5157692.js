In fact, it maintains a flexible schema model. DynamoQL, aligning with this characteristic, is built upon the idea of Schemas and is fully compatible with DynamoDB. While DynamoDB allows for dynamic and evolving data structures, DynamoQL leverages the concept of Schema to provide developers with a structured and organized approach to working with DynamoDB. This compatibility ensures that developers using DynamoQL can seamlessly navigate and interact with the rich features of DynamoDB, all within the context of a well-defined schema.","slug":"/category/schema","permalink":"/dynamoql-site/docs/category/schema","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Introduction","permalink":"/dynamoql-site/docs/intro"},"next":{"title":"Define a Schema","permalink":"/dynamoql-site/docs/schema/Define a Schema"}}}')}}]);
