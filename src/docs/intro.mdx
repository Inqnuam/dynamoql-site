# Introduction

DynamoQL emerges as a response to the growing complexity of managing DynamoDB tables, a task that can quickly become challenging as an application scales. Maintaining a DynamoDB database, while powerful, can pose significant challenges, especially when schemas evolve. DynamoQL positions itself as a solution to alleviate the cognitive load on developers by providing a vastly improved development experience compared to the AWS SDK. With a strong emphasis on type checking, DynamoQL simplifies the data management process, offering a more intuitive and robust solution for developers working with DynamoDB.

## Getting Started

DynamoQL is thoughtfully designed to accommodate various project setups, offering compatibility in both ESM (ECMAScript Modules) and CommonJS formats.  
With a remarkably lightweight footprint of just 50KB, DynamoQL ensures efficiency without compromising functionality.  
Notably, DynamoQL stands out as a hassle-free integration, as it does not require a bundler for seamless functionality within your projects, promoting a straightforward and streamlined development experience.


DynamoQL is built upon the concept of a Schema, providing a structured and organized approach to working with DynamoDB. Once installed, the recommended starting point for developers is to delve into the documentation, beginning with the section on [Schema](/docs/category/schema). Understanding the Schema is foundational to harnessing the full power of DynamoQL, as it defines the structure and rules governing the data interactions with DynamoDB. Exploring the Schema documentation early in the process ensures a solid grasp of the core principles, enabling developers to make the most of DynamoQL's capabilities for efficient DynamoDB operations.
